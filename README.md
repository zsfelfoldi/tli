## Trustless Log Index

This repository contains resources related to the Trustless Log Index project.

Latest specification: [EIP-7745B](https://github.com/zsfelfoldi/tli/blob/main/eip-7745b.md)

Note that this latest design is not an EIP yet (will be soon, after some polishing). This is a different approach achieving the same goals as the original [EIP-7745](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7745) which is still an active EIP, current status is DFId for Glamsterdam because of its high complexity. The new design will probably replace it once proven in practice that it can achieve better performance and lower protocol complexity.
